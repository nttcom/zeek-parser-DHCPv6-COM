# Zeek-Parser-DHCPv6-COM

## Overview

Zeek-Parser-DHCPv6-COM is a Zeek plug-in that can analyze communication using DHCPv6(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6).

## Usage

### Package Manager

```
zkg refresh
zkg install zeek-parser-DHCPv6-COM
```

After executing the command above, this plug-in will be added to available plug-ins. 

`dhcpv6.log` will be generated by the command below:

```
zeek -Cr /usr/local/zeek/var/lib/zkg/clones/package/zeek-parser-DHCPv6-COM/testing/Traces/test.pcap zeek-parser-DHCPv6-COM
```

```
~$ git clone https://github.com/nttcom/zeek-parser-DHCPV6-COM.git
```

Compile source code and copy the object files to the following path.
```
~$ cd ~/zeek-parser-DHCPV6-COM/analyzer
~$ spicyz -o dhcpv6.hlto dhcpv6.spicy zeek_dhcpv6.spicy dhcpv6.evt 
# dhcpv6.hlto will be generated
~$ cp dhcpv6.hlto /usr/local/zeek/lib/zeek-spicy/modules/
```

Then, copy the zeek file to the following paths.
```
~$ cd ~/zeek-parser-DHCPV6-COM/scripts/
~$ cp main.zeek /usr/local/zeek/share/zeek/site/DHCPV6.zeek
```

Finally, import the Zeek plugin.
```
~$ tail /usr/local/zeek/share/zeek/site/local.zeek
... Omit ...
@load DHCPV6
```

This plug-in generates a `dhcpv6.log` by the command below:
```
~$ cd ~/zeek-parser-DHCPV6-COM/testing/Traces
~$ zeek -Cr test.pcap /usr/local/zeek/share/zeek/site/DHCPV6.zeek
```

## Log type and description
This plug-in monitors all functions of dhcpv6 and outputs them as `dhcpv6.log`.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ts | time | timestamp of the communication |
| SrcIP | addr | source IP address  |
| SrcMAC | string | source MAC address |
| Hostname | string | name of the host |
| FingerPrint | vector[count] | Identifier of a particular computer, server, virtual machine, system, application, tool or environment |
| EnterpriseNumber | count | Number of occurrences of a company or organization's identification number |
| VendorClass | string | Vendor-provided client software, device type and version information |

An example of `dhcpv6.log` is as follows:
